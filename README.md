<h3 align="left">Descripton</h3>

In our daily life or in our home life, our homes need many maintenance services on an ongoing basis, whether it is in home appliances or others.
We may need a worker or service provider to repair the required service. For example, when you need an electrician, you may need to go outside the house and search for the appropriate repairman, and you may not get him.

The main idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe application is to establish a communication link between the homeowner and the worker or service provider to provide all the necessary repairs that the customer requests.
After facilitating communication between the customer and the service provider, there are many advantages provided by the application to improve the user experience in using the application in an integrated manner in the easiest way.
